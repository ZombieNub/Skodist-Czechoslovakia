  CZE_economic_clock_desc:0 "The economic frenzy caused by our latest economic policies are demonstrating dramatic growth, but are making many in the country uneasy. Money seems to be dissapearing faster than it's being generated, and more and more people are racking up enormous amounts of debt just to keep up. Politicians in the council seem to be willfully ignoring the problem, claiming that a new economic standard is settling itself and the unprecedented oppertunity will soon show itself. While some pretend to believe the words of the council, many are beginning to fear for their economic futures. If the situation proves too destabilizing, we could suffer an economic catastrophe, which will let interal and external interest groups take advantage of our temporary weakness."
