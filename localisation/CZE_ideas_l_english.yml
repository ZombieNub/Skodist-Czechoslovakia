 CZE_home_of_skodism_desc:0 "Skodism, the fourth way of politics, has birthed itself within Czechoslovakia. An ideology centered around the industrial transformation of society, our new state is lacking in allies. Until the direst of circumstances come about, we may be unable to gain protection from the great powers of the world. We must remain vigilant, and our diplomatic and military abilities must remain open, lest the foreign powers decide to rip Czechoslovakia apart, and make us the second Poland."
 CZE_revolution_scars:0 "Scars Of The Revolution"
 CZE_revolution_scars_desc:0 "The revolution that brought Skodism to Czechoslovakia was a violent one, and as such has ruined much of the country, ironically for us causing the market to grind to a halt. Our citizens desperately try to scrape by while criminals run rampant across the horridly corrupt regional autonomies. It is now our duty to repair the country and restore it to its former glory in order to achieve Skodism, though many wonder how and when that could come about.\n\n§WObtain over §Y50 £civ_factory  Civilian Factories §Wand §Y70% £stability_texticon  Stability §Wto eliminate this spirit.§!§!§!§!§!"
 CZE_politics_are_fucked:0 "Skodist Political Divides"
 #CZE_politics_are_fucked_desc:0 "Despite initial unity, the Skodist Political Council running the country has devolved into petty squabbles between rivaling factions, each with their own interests and diplomatic alignment. The Democratic Skodist Party is made up of former Czech politicians, and wish to devolve power back down to the Czechoslovakian government, and leave us only to manage the economy. The Autonomists, established by former syndicalists, want to end all authority from all government bodies and turn the country into a large commune. The \"Old Revolutionaries\", formed by Klement Gottwald, propose the use of military power and subersive elements to achieve Global Skodism. Finally, while not techinally a faction, several paramilitaries utilized during the revolution wish to have the council's authority, and their authority, made supreme. All of these factions, besides the Autonomists, recieve foreign support from great powers, and the libertarian wing is the only one that really recieves any political support from the Czechoslovakian population."
 CZE_politics_are_fucked_desc:0 "The Skodist Economic Council has been internally divided ever since the previous government was toppled, and is plagued by eternal debates, relentless petty attacks, and tribalism. Some speculate that the only resolution to the current conflict is to allow one faction to achieve supremacy over the others, while others claim that devolution to the former government will ease tensions. No matter which path is taken, our country will be unable to make internal political moves until this crisis is resolved."
 CZE_just_fuck_me_up_fam_army:0 "Military Legacy of the Skodist Revolution"
 CZE_just_fuck_me_up_fam_army_desc:0 "Despite the equipment and profesionalization of the Czechoslovakian army, we won the revolution on the backs of state militias, private armies, and support from the population. As such, the current Skodist army is a botched together mess of irregulars and political leaders, with little care for army cohesion or consistent structure. The army is loyal, however, and constantly willing to defend the revolution, aside from a handful of authoritarian radicals. Serious reforms need to be undertaken to fix the army and get it into a proper fighting mode, once the poltical will becomes generated to do so."
 CZE_regional_autonomy_start:0 "Regional Autonomy"
 CZE_regional_autonomy_start_desc:0 "In order to succeed in the Revolution, autonomous rights were offered to the individual regions of Czechoslovakia, especially in Slovakia, to the point where the previous Slovak government has never relinquished its authority, but merely governs with the Council's permission. While mocked as positively feudal, this presents a serious problem for the Council, in which the Skodist potential of the country is hampered by petty poiticians and local regulations. Clamping down on these rights would be fairly easy, though the backlash could be immense, and some propose we just negotiate to get them removed, even if that would take longer."
 CZE_regional_autonomy_crushed:0 "Regional Autonomy Crushed"
 CZE_regional_autonomy_crushed_desc:0 "As part of our Skodist revolution, the autonomous regions of Czechoslovakia have been eliminated, and local laws reformed to become more compatable with Skodism. While there has been resistance by local leaders and agitators, most of Czechoslovakia seems to have accepted our demands for the sake of the revolution. Our regime is now ascendent throughout Czechoslovakia, however some in the Council worry about our heavy-handed actions, especially those in the libertarian wing. Others worry if the anger is bigger than it seems, and are prepared to take over the government should things turn out not so stable as was originally perceived."
 CZE_regional_autonomy_z_conspiracy:0 "The Z Conspiracy"
 CZE_regional_autonomy_z_conspiracy_desc:0 "Unexpectedly, or perhaps entirely predictably, the local councils have moved underground after our supression, and have formed into the Z conspiracy. Handling this regional unrest will be easy and won't topple our regime, though it won't be quick. Our current setup of militias will not be enough to round up the councils all at once, and as such we'll have to concentrate forces and attack one at a time. The foreign powers however, are looking to tear apart our nation during this period of instability, and we must tread carefully."

 CZE_industry_1:0 "Birth of a New Industry"
 CZE_industry_1_desc:0 "Czechoslovakia began as a capitalist state, and as such, the industry is outdated and archaic. New companies are becoming established under the Skodist production model, though debates rage over if Skodism should move outward or inward. Those who argue outward promote international tradeas the key to peace and prosperity, as we can share our manufacturing with the world and make a profit while making the idea of invasion untenable. Those who argue inward find international trade securing peace a naive and irresponsible idea, and instead Skodism must secure itself against foreign invasion, even if it means restricing trade. Whatever path we go down, we must decide carefully."
 CZE_industry_2_outward:0 "Outward-Facing Industry"
 CZE_industry_2_outward_desc:0 "The modern caravan treks the roads of Europe, delivering piles upon piles of Skodist consumer goods and military equipment. States grow large in resources as we grow large in wealth. A toast, to Skodism!"
 CZE_industry_2_inward:0 "Inward-Facing Industry"
 CZE_industry_2_inward_desc:0 "The idealism of international free trade is a foolish one when foreign powers look hungry upon our territory. Instead of demilitarizing, we must keep watch for enemy armies, and defend the revolution when the need arises. A pledge, to Skodism!"

 CZE_rifles_everywhere:0 "A Rifle In Each Hand"
 CZE_rifles_everywhere_desc:0 "Militarizing the population has not only boosted the miltiary industry in the civilian sector, it has also helped instill a sense of pride into the average Skodist. Behind every door there is a rife, and before every city there is a militia ready to defend it. The amount of rebels ready to tear us apart is dwarfed by loyalists ready to secure our regime against any threat, and good on them! Let the agitators shout, they shall be drowned out by citizens of the revolution!"
