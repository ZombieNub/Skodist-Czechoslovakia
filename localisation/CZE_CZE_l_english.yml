  CZE_cement_capitalist_theory_desc:0 "Skoda was created in the capitalist mode of production, alongside the rest of Czechoslovakian industry. It's best to adopt Capitalism to ease the transition into Skodism as well as create ample opportunity for other industries to take their place."
  CZE_promote_consumerism:0 "Promote Consumerism"
  CZE_promote_consumerism_desc:0 "Thousands of products are produced daily, from the lowest of shopkeeps to the highest of industrial baron, and yet, many of these products rarely sell out. So much labor goes into each product, and its left to rot by an uncaring market. It is the duty of the Council to make the consumers care, and have them buy up as much product as possible, even if its against their best interests!"

  CZE_a_company_with_a_state_desc:0 "We have a unique system of government. There is not so much a country that governs with the rule of law, but rather a company that governs with the rule of the dollar. However arrangement the foreign powers decide to use to deride our revolution, we must embrace this unusual aspect of ourselves. We are not a state with a company, we are a company with a state!"
  CZE_eliminate_local_autonomy:0 "Eliminate Local Autonomy"
  CZE_eliminate_local_autonomy_desc:0 "We made deals with the individual regions of Czechoslovakia to preserve their autonomy and privileges, especially Slovakia. However, these concessions have proven harmful to both the economy and Skodism as a whole. This must be put to an end! All of Czechoslovakia shall be subservient to Skodism, and let the consequences be damned!"
  CZE_rebuild_transportation:0 "Rebuild Transportation"
  CZE_rebuild_transportation_desc:0 "The rail lines have been wrecked by the revolution, and roads have been churned up, completely wrecked, or simply left to decay. We must start a Transport Reconstruction Company, and accelerate the reconstruction of this country!"
  CZE_reform_heavy_industry:0 "Regulation Slashing"
  CZE_reform_heavy_industry_desc:0 "The previous government under socialist pressures have implemented various short-sighted measures to curtail the excesses of capitalism. Under skodism, these measures are unnecessary, and we must end all constraints unfairly put upon business owners and accelerate the development of the market."
  CZE_complete_the_revolution:0 "Complete The Revolution"
  CZE_complete_the_revolution_desc:0 "Much of the Skoda model of production is in place within the Bohemian region, but much of the country is still laboring under archaic and inefficient models. Even worse, the revolution that brought Skodism to Czechoslovakia has not done nice things to the stores and free market as a whole. We must bring these regions up to speed and repair what has been damaged if we are ever to achieve Skodism."
  CZE_corporate_skodism:0 "Corporate Skodism"
  CZE_corporate_skodism_desc:0 "It was Skoda that led our Revolution, and it must be Skoda that leads our productive capabilities into a glorious future! Put the industrialists in charge of the Skodist Economic Council and let them direct the industries, so that all of Czechoslovakia can reap the fruits of Skodan labor."
  CZE_advance_consumer_industries:0 "Advance Consumer Industries"
  CZE_advance_consumer_industries_desc:0 "Skodism is not going to leave the population as a destitute unstable wreck. The stores must reopen and be pushed to excellence, if only to allow the Czechoslovakian people a basic amount of living."
  CZE_inward_focus:0 "Inward Focus"
  CZE_inward_focus_desc:0 "As much as our economy is tied to the outside world, we must be wary of foreign tyrants that wish to eliminate our sovereignty. A buildup of the military industry is necessary to secure our revolution and save the heartland of Skodism!"
  CZE_a_moral_duty:0 "A Moral Duty"
  CZE_a_moral_duty_desc:0 "A new paper has been circulating among the intelligentsia titled "Skodism with a Human Face". It outlines the necessity of Skodist countries to provide welfare to the citizens in order to increase the living standard and the reputation of Skodism as a whole. The Welfare And General Aid Company must endorse this paper and adopt its ideals, and show the world that we care about the people!"
  CZE_outward_focus:0 "Outward Focus"
  CZE_outward_focus_desc:0 "The strongest defense of Skodism shall not be the military, but the market! We must tie ourselves to the world's market to make the prospect of invasion untenable for any power wishing to have a balanced budget!"
  CZE_the_good_capitalist:0 "The Good Capitalist"
  CZE_the_good_capitalist_desc:0 "The socialist agitators in the streets stir up a frenzied mob, constantly attacking capitalists for their "hoarded wealth" and "terrible working conditions". But are these complaints wrong? Hasn't the worker suffered enough under brutal conditions? The Welfare And General Aid Company will be established, a charity that shall assist companies and individuals to make labor both appealing and profitable."
  CZE_skoda_works:0 "Skoda Works!"
  CZE_skoda_works_desc:0 "Skoda is the future of industry! The future of Capitalism! The future of the free market! The future of mankind!"
  CZE_every_man_a_shopkeep:0 "Every Man a Shopkeep"
  CZE_every_man_a_shopkeep_desc:0 "There's nothing fundamental that separates the average worker from the highest billionaire. We all have two hands, a brain, and require food. Every man has the potential to become an aspiring capitalist, and we shall encourage this by slashing further regulations that unfairly punish the average citizen trying to achieve their place in the free market."
  CZE_supply_the_war_machines:0 "Supply The War Machines"
  CZE_supply_the_war_machines_desc:0 "Our nation is not the only one that has an army that needs feeding. Nations across the world need copious amounts of steel to fuel their war machines. While war is certainly brutal, this is a market dying for additional suppliers. Who better to supply the world than the Skodists? Besides, with ourselves as the dominant material producers, no country would want to spoil such a good thing, right?"
  CZE_a_shovel_in_each_hand:0 "A Shovel In Each Hand"
  CZE_a_shovel_in_each_hand_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly evident that our military is inadequate and cannot face the powers of the world. As our war industry is starting to build up, it's obvious that our current resource market is not up to task. The Resource Management Company must be created, and begin supplying people with tools for resource collection so steel can be found in the most unlikely of places."
  CZE_skoda_supremacy:0 "Skoda Supremacy"
  CZE_skoda_supremacy_desc:0 "What made Skoda so great was its ability to expand into several major industries and dominate the economy of Czechoslovakia. This only proves their ability to make profit and churn out material like no other. Other industries must follow the dictates and methods of Skoda, and if they don't abide, they must die out, like in any other free market economy."
  CZE_a_rifle_in_each_hand:0 "A Rifle In Each Hand"
  CZE_a_rifle_in_each_hand_desc:0 "The defense of Skodism must come from the people themselves. While militias can mutiny, rebel, or simply lose confidence in Skodism, we require a backup in case foreign powers decide to tear apart our revolution. Arming the people also grants the population patriotism and the ability to defend their personal interest in the revolution. Skodism fights for the people, and the people shall fight for Skodism!"
  CZE_profits_profits_profits:0 "Profits! Profits! Profits!"
  CZE_profits_profits_profits_desc:0 "While the revolution is still incomplete, we have managed to put Czechoslovakia on the road towards complete Skodism, and Skodist methods are all across the country, churning out great stockpiles of resources, consumer goods, and military equipment. Long Live The Skodist Revolution! Long Live Skodism!"
  CZE_denounce_savings:0 "Denounce Savings"
  CZE_denounce_savings_desc:0 "Money can't do anything if it's left to rot in a bank vault for the rest of time! Any reason to keep money instead of spending it is ridiculous! The superstitious people of Czechoslovakia must be taught to treat their money as their own! We must break down these savings accounts and denounce any future money hoarding for the sake of the market!"

  CZE_crack_open_the_international_markets_desc:0 "Up until now, archaic restrictions have dominated international trade, from protectionist tariffs to colonial mercantilism. Thankfully, methods have been developed to circumvent these blockages and achieve free trade. The World Trade Federation shall be established to assist smugglers and merchants in performing free trade, though this shall only last as long as the governments permit them to..."

  CZE_politics_skodism_fascism_desc:0 "The Z conspiracy has shown the weakness of the central government and its inability to work properly with the Skodist Economic Council. This rotten instiution has been plaguing the revolution ever since its inception, and we have no need of it anymore. Its time to abolish the civilian government and grant the Skodist Economic Council full power!"

  CZE_seize_civilian_institutions_desc:0 "The Skodist Economic Council is now in our hands, but we now must turn to the government instiutions outside of the Council. Checks imposed by the spineless Civilian Skodists to justify their own inaction have allowed the Z Unions to get as bad as they are. Now that they are depowered, we must destroy these instiutions and give the government full ability to act!"
  CZE_out_with_anarchists:0 "The Fantasy Revolution"
  CZE_out_with_anarchists_desc:0 "The libertarian breakaways may claim to be the true revolution, however they are merely the angry dying spasms of anarchism corrupted into a civilian form. Their name, the \"Original Revolutionaries\" is nothing but a farce, and only portrays hubris. Its time to end this vestigial faction, and with the paramilitaries on our side, they won't have a chance!"
  CZE_the_moscow_plot:0 "The Moscow Plot"
  CZE_the_moscow_plot_desc:0 "At last, the elite faction and its recalcitrant student unions has been revealed for what they truly are. Documents uncovered by our paramilitaries reveal a terrible story: The Z unions, student unions, and members of the USUS have all been taking bribes from the Soviet Union to undermine the revolution. We must redouble our efforts and crush these elites, lest they launch their revolution tomorrow!"
  CZE_fascism_empower_paramilitaries:0 "Private Peacekeepers"
  CZE_fascism_empower_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Paramilitarism is a primary political affair, and is not meant to be profitable. As such, our private paramilitaries will struggle to exist in the free market framework, unless we propose something radical. We shall transform them into private police companies, which the capitalists can hire to protect their businesses from theives and rebels."
  CZE_fascism_economic_councils:0 "Market Militarism"
  CZE_fascism_economic_councils_desc:0 "Several vanguards are interested in pushing Market Militarism, where the military leaders are able to set up private companies to generate wealth for the paramilitaries and council. This, they say, will not only increase the amount of profitable businesses in the country, but also provide paramilitaries easy labor outside of their organizations. We must authorize this as soon as possible."
  CZE_fascism_vanguard_bueracrats:0 "Advance Skodism Military Council"
  CZE_fascism_vanguard_bueracrats_desc:0 "A new and suprising corporate is starting to emerge and dominate the poiice market. Calling themselves the Advance Skodism Military Council, or ASMC, they are a police corporate specialized in quelling strikes and attacking political opponents.  They are large in number and highly diciplined, so we must hire them ourselves to keep the Skodist revolution in tact."
  CZE_fascism_ex_officer_warnings:0 "Professional Militias"
  CZE_fascism_ex_officer_warnings_desc:0 "The Militia is a weapon of the local community, and under Skodism, it is a defender and arsenal of the revolution. Being a militiaman is a job like any other, and as such shall not be restricted by region or culture. The militias henceforth shall be reorganized into corporate entities, and the militia volunteers turned into employees!"
  CZE_fascism_tank_militias:0 "Army On Wheels"
  CZE_fascism_tank_militias_desc:0 "Our humble militia companies are dedicated defenders of the revolution, but they are just that-humble militia. Luckily, the market is becoming stronger by the day, and our militia companies are becoming more and more able to purchase and research luxury equipment. We can use this to form highly mobile armies on wheels, who can defend the borders and tackle the enemy with efficiency."
  CZE_fascism_exclude_radicals:0 "An Army Moves On Its Market"
  CZE_fascism_exclude_radicals_desc:0 "The restrictions on the sale of military equipment are plainly ridiculous. The common citizen is educated enough to be able to operate all sorts of military equipment and properly defend themselves from potential threats. Its time to free the market on military equipment, and bring not only profits into the hands of the militia companies, but also tanks and bombers into the hands of civilians."
  CZE_fascism_internal_security:0 "Skodist Internal Security Corporation"
  CZE_fascism_internal_security_desc:0 "The civilian and elite elements of Czechoslovakia may have been made irrelevent, but they aren't gone completely. We must establish a new company to investigate both vanguards and ex-officers to make sure we aren't being undermined from within. Those who we know to be legitimate can be put into strong posistions of power, and influence our country in great ways."

To bolster our defensive efforts, we shall establish the Department of Military Affairs, and have both paramilitaries and militias be under their direction. Naturally, the vanguards and ex-officers will be competing for influence and funding, so this current political split will become ever more relevant."
