  CZE_reform_heavy_industry_desc:0 "The previous government under socialist pressures have implemented various short-sighted measures to curtail the excesses of capitalism.

  CZE_complete_the_revolution_desc:0 "Much of the Skoda model of production is in place within the Bohemian region, but much of the country is still laboring under archaic and inefficient models. Even worse, the revolution that brought Skodism to Czechoslovakia has not done nice things to the stores and free market as a whole. We must bring these regions up to speed and repair what has been damaged if we are ever to achieve Skodism."

  CZE_supply_the_war_machines_desc:0 "Our nation is not the only one that has an army that needs feeding. Nations across the world need copious amounts of steel to fuel their war machines. While war is certainly brutal, this is a market dying for additional suppliers. Who better to supply the world than the Skodists? Besides, with ourselves as the dominant material producers, no country would want to spoil such a good thing, right?"
  CZE_a_shovel_in_each_hand:0 "A Shovel In Each Hand"
  CZE_a_shovel_in_each_hand_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly evident that our military is inadequate and cannot face the powers of the world. As our war industry is starting to build up, it's obvious that our current resource market is not up to task. The Resource Management Company must be created, and begin supplying people with tools for resource collection so steel can be found in the most unlikely of places."
  CZE_skoda_supremacy:0 "Skoda Supremacy"
  CZE_skoda_supremacy_desc:0 "What made Skoda so great was its ability to expand into several major industries and dominate the economy of Czechoslovakia. This only proves their ability to make profit and churn out material like no other. Other industries must follow the dictates and methods of Skoda, and if they don't abide, they must die out, like in any other free market economy."
  CZE_a_rifle_in_each_hand:0 "A Rifle In Each Hand"
  CZE_a_rifle_in_each_hand_desc:0 "The defense of Skodism must come from the people themselves. While militias can mutiny, rebel, or simply lose confidence in Skodism, we require a backup in case foreign powers decide to tear apart our revolution. Arming the people also grants the population patriotism and the ability to defend their personal interest in the revolution. Skodism fights for the people, and the people shall fight for Skodism!"

  CZE_profits_profits_profits_desc:0 "While the revolution is still incomplete, we have managed to put Czechoslovakia on the road towards complete Skodism, and Skodist methods are all across the country, churning out great stockpiles of resources, consumer goods, and military equipment. Long Live The Skodist Revolution! Long Live Skodism!"
  CZE_denounce_savings:0 "Denounce Savings"
  CZE_denounce_savings_desc:0 "Money can't do anything if it's left to rot in a bank vault for the rest of time! Any reason to keep money instead of spending it is ridiculous! The superstitious people of Czechoslovakia must be taught to treat their money as their own! We must break down these savings accounts and denounce any future money hoarding for the sake of the market!"

It would be drastically unwise to abandon these great instiutions, though we should no longer hold them in public hands.
