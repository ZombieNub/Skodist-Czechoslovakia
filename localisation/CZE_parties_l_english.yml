 #skodism_democratic_desc:0 "Civilian Skodism, as it has been described, is a devolutionary ultracapitalist ideology that sees the central government, mainly led by business leaders and bribed politicians, take a largely hands off role in the economy, letting economic councils run the market, or if no councils exist, just leave the market to run itself. This has been described as market liberalism by some and anarcho-capitalism by others, but one item remains the same: The market reigns supreme."
 #skodism_communism:0 "Elite Skodism"
 #skodism_communism_desc:0 "Elite Skodism comes in many forms, however the primary distinguishing factor is the lack of a free market, instead having a technocratic council of influential people handling the production of all goods in a country. Borrowing elements from both Skodism and Corporatism, this ideology is seen as the inevitable conclusion of Skodism, especially by its promoters."
 #skodism_fascism:0 "Military Skodism"
 #skodism_fascism_desc:0 "Military Skodism is a rough ideology that sees the army and market as one and the same, and attempts to achieve \"Military Capitalism\". Led by the high ranking military personell, it's not uncommon to find stores owned by military veterans whose purpose is to raise funds for the national army to conquer areas to grab goods to sell in their stores."
 #skodism_neutrality:0 "Anarchist Skodism"
 #skodism_neutrality_desc:0 "Libertarian Skodism is an ideal held by man early Skodist thinkers and revolutionaries. Seeing the government as the ultimate burden on the market, Libertarians wish to eliminate all forms of authority unrelated to capitalism, and are determined to give companies full liberty to perform as they wish. While decried as unrealistic, Libertarians are willing to fight to the death for their revolution, and as such are valuable for any Skodist revolution."
