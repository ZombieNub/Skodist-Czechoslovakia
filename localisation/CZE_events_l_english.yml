 skodism.1.t:0 "Welcome to Skodist Czechoslovakia!"
 skodism.1.d:0 "Have a bored looking image of Neville."
 skodism.1.a:0 "Why does this mod exist?"

 #Z Conspiracy Chain
 skodism.2.t:0 "Stirrings Of Resentment"
 skodism.2.d:0 "The relative ease with which we clamped down on local autonomy seems to have been a farce. Recent reports from all over Czechoslovakia, especially in Slovakia, reveal groups working to restore their previous rights now denied to them. Many of these groups are disconnected and vary in their recruitment and structure, and are only united in their opposistion to the Skodist Revolution. The most prominent opposistion groups exist among Slovak nationalist and student organizations, which could present unique problems for our government in the long term. Many in the Council are calling for the arrest of these \"Z Unions\", but the current police forces are lacking in population and funding, and we would need to use the local militias and paramilitary groups. Relying on the police forces would be effective in maintaining stability, but it might take a long time to handle all the groups."
 skodism.2.a:0 "Send the paramilitaries to secure the student groups."
 skodism.2.b:0 "Hold back the paramilitaries, let the police handle this."
 skodism.3.t:0 "Civilian Government Working With Z Unions"
 skodism.3.d:0 "The issue of the Z unions has shown itself to be much bigger than we originally thought. Documents uncovered by paramilitary groups have revealed to us that the old Czech and Slovak governments have been covertly working with locals to overthrow the revolution in a coup and end Skodism. This has come to a massive shock to the Council, as well as most of the old civilian government, who have sworn to not know what's going on. This issue is quickly getting out of hand, especially since the veracity of the documents is under question by both Council members and Czech politicians. The country is about to be thrown into chaos, and something needs to happen!"
 skodism.3.a:0 "Declare martial law and put the Czech and Slovak governments under arrest."
 skodism.3.b:0 "Arrest the paramilitary leaders for fabrication of evidence."
 skodism.4.t:0 "Paramilitaries March On Prague"
 skodism.4.d:0 "Yesterday, at 0700, paramilitaries from across the country have marched on Prague, the capital of our revolution, and have declared martial law. Much of the old Czech and Slovak governments have fled to Poland, Austria, and Britain, hoping to avoid the potential mass arrests. The Skodist Economic Council was stormed by the more fanatical revolutionaries, and while not disbanding the council, has permanently established the \"Revolutionary Guard\", and replacing the president of the council with one of their own. Heads of government and former autonomy leaders have fled or been summarily excecuted by paramilitaries all across the country. The new president has given a speech to the people of Prague, declaring he will not stop until every member of the Z Conspiracy has been arrested and put on trial. The nation now holds its breath..."
 skodism.4.a:0 "The revolution has been saved!"
 skodism.5.t:0 "The National Strike"
 skodism.5.d:0 "The economy of this country has ground to a halt, as student groups wishing for old autonomous rights are striking in factories all across Czechoslovakia, demanding devolution of power and more power given back to the Czech government. Our police has been unable to supress the groups, even while they were underground, and now that they are out in public, paramilitaries have had to step in to quell this crisis. Certain paramilitary leaders, however, ave been actively antagonizing these student groups and enforcing brutal repression, which is only drawing more people into the strikes. Czechoslovakia can only watch in horror as battles between the two groups start cropping up more often and cause more and more brutal violence. What happens next has shocked Czechoslovakia..."
 skodism.5.a:0 "The paramilitaries crush the strikers."
 skodism.5.b:0 "The strikers push back the paramilitaries."
 skodism.6.t:0 "Strikers March On Prague"
 skodism.6.d:0 "Workers all across Prague, encouraged by their victory over the paramilitaries, have marched into the central government and demanded the immediate resignation of the current civilian government and abolishment of the government in its entirety. Intimidated by chants of ending \"the fascist paramilitaries and their stooges in the government\", politicians have resigned en masse, and new elections have been called to the new provisional People's Civilian Council. The Skodist Economic Council is still in place, but seems to be under the direction of the student groups due to concessions made in order to stop the national strike. The revolution has taken a socialist turn, but it's still Skodism, or so says the civilian council."
 skodism.6.a:0 "Skodism is for the People!"
 skodism.7.t:0 "The Scars Are Gone!"
 skodism.7.d:0 "The factories across the country are running at full capacity as the average worker walks into his business without fear of terrorism or kidnapping. Aspiring businessmen flock to our Skodist revolution, seeking oppertunity and fleeing the oppressive constraints forced upon them by their former countries. The new \"ultracapitalist mode of production\" that we are embracing is starting to see international respect. Schoolchildren sing our anthems with pride in the newly reconstructed schools, and new graduates are actively advancing our productive capabilities towards new heights. Our country is finally stable, and the revolution can finally be accomplished."
 skodism.7.a:0 "A toast, to Skodism!"
 skodism.8.t:0 "Protests In The Capital"
 skodism.8.d:0 "The people of Prague have grown wary of our actions. Accusations of fabrication of evidence to go after our political rivals have put the population on edge, ready to strike against our regime if things go too far. It seems that our crackdown on the elite faction has been the straw to break the camel's back, and now people from all across the country are protesting against our regime, demanding the resignation of the current president and the disbandment of all paramilitaries. These protestors lack tact and have no political leadership, so negotiation is currently impossible, as any demand that would satsify them would betray the revolution."
 skodism.8.a:0 "Send in the paramilitaries to pacify them."
 skodism.9.t:0 "Riot Into Revolt"
 skodism.9.d:0 "The prague protesters have refused to go down without a fight, and while the paramilitaries began gathering outside of Prague, the citizens have taken to building barricades and flying flags, proclaiming our regime as illegitmate and demanding the reenstatement of the Civilian government. The paramilitaries are at the ready to end these protesters, and declare they can do so with ease, though the precise strategy is in question. Some in the paramilitary command, especially the radical vanguards, advocate for a full attack to drive out the protestors as quickly as possible and save Czechoslovakia. The more professional ex-officers, however, propose that we hold back the troops and letting the artillery pieces take care of the protestors and their barricades. Whichever we side with, it seems as if Prague will not be in the brightest condition."
 skodism.9.a:0 "The vanguards are right! Attack with all forces!"
 skodism.9.b:0 "The ex-officers are right! Lets the guns sing!"
 skodism.10.t:0 "The Second Battle Of Prague"
 skodism.10.d:0 "Much as the original Skodist revolution was won by paramilitaries, the revolution has been secured by our loyal paramilitaries once again. Now the revolution can continue with full force, without intervention from petty authorities or opposistion from Moscow-funded political groups. We shall restore order to this country once and for all, and truly establish Skodism as the one poilitic, the one way of running a country, the one ideology for the world!"
 skodism.10.a:0 "Skodism Forever!"
 skodism.11.t:0 "Vanguards And Ex-Officers"
 skodism.11.d:0 "The military faction ever since the beginning of the revolution is not a united front in service of or fighting against anything in particular. The main interest that has united all the paramilitaries together is their shared contribution to, and privileges from, the Skodist revolution. Cracks under the surface once papered over are now harming our ability to govern effectively. Our faction is effectively split between the vanguards and the ex-officiers. The vanguards are our more political faction, made up from the paramilitary leaders from the start of the revolution. While actively dedicated to the revolution and national security, they carry less tact and operate with far less dicipline. Meanwhile, the ex-officers, who are made up of the defectionary Czech and Slovak generals during the revolution, concern themselves with the military of the nation and its proper functioning. While apolitical on the surface, they carry great influence overall, and may oppose some of our more radical actions. Both factions are determined to prevent the other from gaining too much power, and if we are to operate this nation properly, we must play both factions against each other properly, and not let either get too much power."
 skodism.11.a:0 "We must tread carefully."
 skodism.12.t:0 "The New Student State"
 skodism.12.d:0 "\"Ladies and Gentlemen of Prague. The old Bohemian regime has been crushed once more beneath the might of the people, and you are ours to thank for your great endeavor. Skodism was designed to grant the people, all people of the whole world, the rights they are naturally born with. The right to capital, the right to labor, and the right to markets. The old democracies, socialist regimes, and new fascist dictatorships seek to undermine your sacred rights in the name of what? Liberty? Bueracracy? The nation? All lies! Do not listen to their sweet words. Only the Skodist doctrine, the Skodist Revolution, is capable of bringing you the liberty they so cherish. We must fight to bring the Skodist revolution to all peoples of the world. Let the old powers tremble, the might of the market is unstoppable! Skodism Knows No Borders!\"\nThe crowds in Prague begin to cheer in response to these words, engrossed by the speakers immortal words. Now, the true Skodist revolution can be pursued in full on the backs of the student unions, old power structures and paramilitaries be damned!"
 skodism.12.a:0 "Three Cheers For Student Skodism!"
 skodism.13.t:0 "The True Bourgeios Revolution"
 skodism.13.d:0 "\"The old economic systems of the world are about to be fully overturned. The liberals of the world have been able to overturn the old Feudal apparatus in the wake of the French Revolution, and now we are here, to overturn the old and dying liberal apparatus. I ask of you, do you want the Socialist Utopia? No, you cry. We shall not have the Soviet Union, you cry. But you are mistaken. The Soviet Union is a state full off contradictions, attempting to achieve the Socialist Utopia without following historical materialism to it's fullest. They have bypassed the Bourgeios Revolution, while we fully embrace it here. One the Bourgeios Revolution has been achieved, then and only then, can the Socialist Revolution be achieved, and thus, the Utopia!\"\nThe crowds gathering outside Prague stand in silence, shocked by our brilliant words. Murmuring begins, and the people being crying out in fear. A spontaneous protest has broken out in the capital, no doubt funded by the Z Unions. We must do away with the old order in full to achieve the Bourgeios revolution, and it starts with the people in Prague."
 skodism.13.a:0 "For the Bourgeios Revolution!"
 skodism.14.t:0 "Z Unions Oppose Corporatism"
 skodism.14.d:0 "The regional autonomous worker movements in the regions outside of Prague have issued formal objections to our economic centralization plans. Commonly known as Z unions, the reasons they cite include ancient privileges, old council promises given to them during and after the revolution, and the lack of democratic elections. In reality, they wish to retain their economic independence from Prague and remain outside of it's authority. The regional governors are already preparing to veto any legislation that attempts to strip their regional governments of their inefficient and corrupt power, and the Z unions are begining to gather equipment to defend their autonomy by force."
 skodism.14.a:0 "Worrying."
 tooltip_event_14:0 "§RWe must end the Z Unions before we can implement corporatism.§!"
